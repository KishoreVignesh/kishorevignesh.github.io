<h4>At School</h3>
<p>
    I had access to computer at a very early age. I was amazed and fascined by computer games. The real interest when i was trying  to connect two computer thought LAN for Counter Strike game. This introuduced me to Networking. On 2010 with the passion took Computer Science as major in my Higher secondary school. I was facinated by world wide web. I wanted to host a server in my home. This introduced me to static and dyanamic ip addresses. Configured Port forwarding in the router to one of my machines in my home. My dynamic ip address was periodically updated by dyn service provided by a third party at that time. I wanted to play LAN based games over internet. Used Himachi product from logmein. It introduced me to Virtual Private Network. On 2012, finished my schooling from KRMM, Chennai.

<h4>At College</h4>
<p>
    With enough interest and fascination enrolled myself in Bachelors of Computer Science Engineering. Enjoyed taking ride at computer science subjects semester by semester. With more curiosity tried Ruby on Rails. It introduced me to Model View Controller, DB migrations, Object relational mapping etc. Tested Python Admin page django. To further fullfill my curiosity, enrolled for SWEBOK course provided by IEEE. This introduced me to Java Programing language. Taught me why low coupling and high cohesion is important. SWEBOK shaped me up as a professional programmer.

    During college, I use to teach computer science through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8w-cG_sPnqXFySYI-ccPjw" target="_blank" >my youtube channel</a>. Teaching and sharing the knowledge help me to gain confidence and leadership skills. It gave me enough foundational briks for moving forward.
